## A Simple HTML Document

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

Example Explained

* The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration defines this document to be HTML5
* The `<html>` element is the root element of an HTML page
* The `<head>` element contains meta information about the document
* The `<title>` element specifies a title for the document
* The `<body>` element contains the visible page content
* The `<h1>` element defines a large heading
* The `<p>` element defines a paragraph

### HTML Documents

All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: **<!DOCTYPE html>**.

The HTML document itself begins with **<html>** and ends with **</html>**.

The visible part of the HTML document is between **<body>** and **</body>**.

### HTML Headings

HTML headings are defined with the **<h1>** to **<h6>** tags.

<h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading.

### HTML Paragraphs

HTML paragraphs are defined with the **<p>** tag.

### HTML Links

HTML links are defined with the **<a>** tag:

Example:

```html
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>
```

The link's destination is specified in the **href attribute**. 

Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements.

### HTML Images

HTML images are defined with the **<img>** tag.

The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes:

Example:

```html
<img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142">
```
